## üîß Post-Deployment Monitoring Recommendations

### **Immediate Monitoring (Required)**
1. **Health Endpoint Monitoring:** Monitor `/api/health` for 200 status every 30 seconds
2. **Enterprise Test Monitoring:** Run security tests daily and alert on any failures
3. **Database Performance:** Monitor query response times and connection counts
4. **Authentication Failures:** Track failed login attempts and suspicious activity

### **Business Metrics Monitoring**
1. **Billing System:** Monitor invoice generation and payment processing
2. **Tenant Activity:** Track tenant usage and growth metrics
3. **Phone Number Routing:** Monitor call routing success rates
4. **Connector Usage:** Track OAuth flow success rates

### **Security Monitoring**
1. **Rate Limiting:** Monitor rate limit hit rates for abuse detection
2. **Cross-Tenant Attempts:** Alert on any unauthorized cross-tenant access attempts
3. **Failed Authentication:** Monitor and alert on suspicious login patterns
4. **Webhook Security:** Monitor Twilio webhook signature validation success

## üîÑ Rollback Procedures

### **Quick Rollback Steps**
1. **Database Rollback:** Use Replit's automatic checkpoint system to restore previous state
2. **Code Rollback:** Git revert to last known good commit if code issues occur
3. **Configuration Rollback:** Restore environment variables to previous working state
4. **Service Restart:** Restart workflows if transient issues occur

### **Rollback Decision Criteria**
- **Immediate Rollback:** If enterprise security tests drop below 90% success rate
- **Planned Rollback:** If authentication system becomes unavailable
- **Emergency Rollback:** If cross-tenant data leakage is detected
