## Required Environment Variables

### Core Application
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/staging/production)
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `PORT`: Server port (defaults to 5000)
- `HOST`: Server host (defaults to 0.0.0.0)

### External Services
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`: Stripe payment processing
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Stripe client-side integration
- `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: Frontend Stripe integration
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY`: Email service integration
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Voice service integration
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Twilio authentication

### Security & Monitoring
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Trusted origin for CORS (production)
- `ADMIN_ALLOWED_IPS`: IP whitelist for admin endpoints (optional)
- `HEALTH_CHECK_ALLOWED_IPS`: IP whitelist for detailed health checks (optional)
- `INTERNAL_REQUEST_TOKEN`: Token for internal health check requests (optional)

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Static File Issues
**Problem**: `‚ùå Static files not found` or 404 errors on frontend assets

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Build not run**: Execute `npm run build` to generate static assets
2. **Symlink creation failed**: Check file system permissions
   - Fallback: Manual copy from `dist/public` to `server/public`
3. **Directory permissions**: Ensure read/write access to server directory

**Verification**:
```bash
ls -la server/public/          # Check if files exist
ls -la dist/public/           # Check build output
curl localhost:5000/         # Test static file serving
```

### Database Connection Issues
**Problem**: Database connection failures or query errors

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Missing DATABASE_URL**: Add PostgreSQL connection string to environment
2. **Schema mismatch**: Run `npm run db:push --force` to sync schema
3. **Connection limits**: Check database provider connection limits

**Verification**:
```bash
curl localhost:5000/health/detailed  # Check database status
```

### Environment Variable Issues
**Problem**: Service integration failures or missing configuration

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Missing API keys**: Verify all required environment variables are set
2. **Invalid key format**: Check API key format and permissions
3. **Service configuration**: Verify external service settings

**Verification**: 
- Smoke tests will identify missing environment variables during startup
- Check service status in detailed health check endpoint

### Rate Limiting Issues
**Problem**: Excessive 429 "Too Many Requests" responses

**Causes & Solutions**:
1. **Legitimate traffic spikes**: Scale application or adjust rate limits
2. **DDoS or abuse**: Review IP patterns and consider IP blocking
3. **Development testing**: Set `NODE_ENV=development` for relaxed limits

**Rate Limit Configuration**:
- Global: 1000/15min (production), 2000/15min (development)
- Auth endpoints: 5/15min (production), 20/15min (development)
- Admin operations: 50/10min (production), 100/10min (development)
- Billing operations: 20/15min (production), 50/15min (development)
- Webhooks: 100/5min (production), 200/5min (development)

### Health Check Endpoints
**Basic Health Check**: `GET /health`
- Public endpoint for load balancers and monitoring
- Returns basic application status and uptime

**Detailed Health Check**: `GET /health/detailed`
- Restricted endpoint with IP whitelisting and token authentication
- Returns memory usage, service status, and system metrics
- Access control via `HEALTH_CHECK_ALLOWED_IPS` and `X-Internal-Request` header

### Security Configuration
The application includes comprehensive production security:

**Security Headers**:
- HSTS with preload (production only)
- Content Security Policy (CSP) with voice feature support
- Cross-Origin policies (COEP/COOP/CORP) with Stripe compatibility
- Permissions Policy allowing microphone/speaker access

**CORS Configuration**:
- Environment-specific trusted origins
- Credential support for authenticated requests
- Preflight request handling

**Audit Logging**:
- Sensitive admin operations logged with user/tenant context
- IP address and user agent tracking
- Timestamp and endpoint logging for security analysis

### Emergency Procedures

**Service Unavailable**:
1. Check application logs for startup errors
2. Verify database connectivity
3. Confirm static file availability
4. Validate environment variable configuration

**Performance Issues**:
1. Monitor memory usage via `/health/detailed`
2. Check database query performance
3. Review rate limiting effectiveness
4. Analyze request patterns

**Security Incidents**:
1. Review audit logs for suspicious activity
2. Check rate limiting effectiveness
3. Verify IP whitelist configuration
4. Monitor authentication failure patterns

### Monitoring & Observability
**Key Metrics to Monitor**:
- Response times for API endpoints
- Rate limit hit rates
- Database connection pool usage
- Memory consumption and garbage collection
- External service response times

**Log Analysis**:
- Search for `[ERROR]` entries for critical issues
- Monitor `[SECURITY AUDIT]` logs for suspicious activity
- Track startup sequence completion
- Review smoke test results in production deployments
