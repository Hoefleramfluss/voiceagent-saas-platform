Enhance the VoiceAgent app with tenant-scoped architecture and a demo tenant:

1) Tenant Context:
   - Add a request-scoped tenant loader (from subdomain/header/JWT).
   - Load tenant settings: Twilio (accountSid, authToken, inbound numbers), STT/TTS config, OpenAI model + REQUIRED system prompt, flow_id + live version, CRM/Calendar connector creds, billing package.
   - Cache per tenant with TTL; enforce isolation.

2) Bot Editor:
   - Add a REQUIRED “System Prompt” field per bot (validate on save/publish).
   - Support template variables ({brand}, {opening_hours}, {language=de-AT}).
   - Do not allow publish if system prompt is empty.

3) Flow Runtime:
   - Ensure live flow is loaded per tenant.
   - Keep Redis session state; support barge-in and retry/fallback to human transfer.

4) Twilio Mapping:
   - Map inbound phone numbers to tenantId.
   - Set webhooks automatically for the demo tenant’s Twilio number.

5) Connectors:
   - Implement connector interfaces for CRM/Calendar (findSlots/createEvent).
   - Provide adapters for Google Calendar and Microsoft Graph; add stubs for common CRMs (HubSpot/Salesforce/Pipedrive) with TODOs for Austrian clinic/dealership systems (to be added when API docs are provided).

6) Demo Tenant:
   - Add a setup wizard: enter Twilio number → verify via Twilio API → auto-configure webhook; choose STT/TTS (Google), set mandatory system prompt, publish a sample flow.
   - Enable drag-and-drop editor; draft/staged/live workflow.

7) Usage & Billing:
   - Track voicebot minutes (media stream) and forwarding minutes (dial segments) per tenant.
   - Monthly aggregation: subtract package free minutes, bill extra minutes + base fee.
   - Keep Stripe backend-only (sk_…); frontend uses pk_… only.

8) Security & Ops:
   - Encrypt connector secrets; add RBAC per tenant.
   - Add health checks for Twilio, STT/TTS, OpenAI, CRM/Calendar.
   - Add audit logs for publishes, prompt changes, connector writes.

Deliverables:
   - DB migrations for tenants, bots, flows, versions, connectors, secrets, numbers, usage_minutes, billing_packages.
   - API endpoints: tenants/{id}/settings, bots CRUD, flows publish, usage reports.
   - Demo tenant wizard UI and happy-path e2e test (inbound call → flow turns → optional calendar write).
